This assignment was memorable for how I misunderstood the requirements and wrote it in binary. I had all the requirements covered, including the extra requirements that required writing the code differently.

But with a few hours to go I talked to the lecturer and he said I had to change the code to do extra stuff.

I ended up ruining the code, but I definitely learnt a LOT about how the compiler and machine code works.
